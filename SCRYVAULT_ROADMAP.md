## Session 3 Progress (Barcode Scanner Investigation)

### ‚ùå **INVESTIGATED & REJECTED - Web-Based Barcode Scanner**
- **Problem**: Attempted to implement real-time barcode scanning via webcam for mobile devices
- **Libraries Tested**: `quagga` (legacy) ‚Üí `@ericblade/quagga2` (modern fork)
- **Testing**: iPhone 16 Pro Max, Edge for iOS, HTTPS deployment on Vercel
- **Issues Encountered**:
  - Poor camera quality and autofocus via WebRTC
  - Blurry/unfocused video feed
  - Unreliable barcode detection
  - UI/UX problems with frame sizing
  - Performance issues on mobile
- **Conclusion**: Web-based barcode scanning is **not viable** for production use
- **Solution**: Focused on excellent manual ISBN entry experience instead

### ‚úÖ **COMPLETED - Simplified Book Entry Flow**
- **Removed barcode scanner UI** - cleaner, simpler interface
- **Single "Add Book" button** - streamlined user flow
- **Manual ISBN entry remains** - fast, reliable, works 100% of the time
- **Automatic book lookup** - still fetches all book details from ISBN

### üìù **Technical Debt Created**
- [ ] Remove `@ericblade/quagga2` package (58 unnecessary dependencies)
- [ ] Delete unused `BarcodeScanner.tsx` component
- [ ] Clean up scan animation CSS
- [ ] Remove barcode scanner state from scan page

### üîÆ **Future Barcode Scanning Options**
If barcode scanning becomes a critical requirement:
1. **Native Mobile App** (Recommended)
   - React Native with native camera APIs
   - ML Kit or Vision API for detection
   - Professional-grade accuracy and UX
2. **Photo Upload + Server-Side OCR**
   - User takes photo, server processes
   - More reliable than real-time streaming
3. **Third-Party SDK** (e.g., Scandit)
   - Professional barcode scanning service
   - Better accuracy, additional cost
