# ScryVault: The Complete Vision & Architecture

## üéØ **Project Overview**

ScryVault is an all-in-one application that transforms the tedious process of selling books online into a streamlined, automated, and profitable operation. By leveraging agentic AI, it tackles the most time-consuming tasks‚Äîsourcing, photography, and listing‚Äîallowing you to focus on growth.

**Core Principle:** The "Scan-to-Live" pipeline - a seamless workflow from acquiring a book to a fully optimized live listing on eBay with minimal manual intervention.
